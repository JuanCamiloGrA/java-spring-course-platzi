# Market Application

## Project Description

This project is a market application developed using Java and Spring Boot. The application is configured to run in different environment profiles (`dev` and `pdn`), allowing for easy configuration and deployment in different environments. It uses Gradle as a build and dependency management tool.

## Knowledge Used

In building this project, I have utilized and deepened my understanding of the following knowledge and technologies:

- **Java**: The main programming language used to develop the application logic.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used to create robust and scalable Java applications.
- **Gradle**: Build tool used to manage dependencies and automate build tasks.
- **Spring Profiles**: Configuration of different environments (`dev` and `pdn`) to facilitate development and deployment.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database management system used to store the application's data.
- **Property Configuration**: Use of `application.properties` and `application-{profile}.properties` files to manage environment-specific configurations.

## Skills Acquired

Thanks to the successful construction of this project, I am enabled to:

- Develop robust and scalable web applications using Java and Spring Boot.
- Configure and manage different development and production environments using Spring profiles.
- Use Gradle for dependency management and build task automation.
- Configure and connect applications to PostgreSQL databases.
- Implement best practices for application configuration and deployment.

This project demonstrates my ability to build complete applications from scratch, manage environment configurations, and use modern development and deployment tools.
